Hyperparameter tuning and Neural Architecture search using Evolutionary Algorithms (Genetic and Memetic Algorihtm)

Combining evolutionary algorithms and deep learning is an exciting and promising area of research that aims to leverage the strengths of both approaches. By doing so, we can potentially improve the efficiency, robustness, and generalization capabilities of deep learning models. Here are some ways in which evolutionary algorithms and deep learning can be combined: Neural Architecture Search (NAS), Hyperparameter Optimization, Population-Based Training, and Data Augmentation Strategies.

Most of the strategies for Hyperparameter tuning : Grid Search or Random Search use domain knowledge and heuristics to find the optimal parameters, but they might not be optimal as lot of values are not explored and have a chance of getting stuck in local minima. Most of the Neural architectures are created based on heuristics or intuition, and no knowledge of model architecture is actually used.


Through this project I aim to apply genetic and memetic algorithm on hyperparameter tuning and neural architecture search. We also demonstrate how to apply memetic algorithm in deep learning and introduce a novel way to train GA for NAS by gradually increasing the number of epochs for training to train faster and remove the redundant process of training poor individuals.
